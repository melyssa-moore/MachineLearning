# Air Quality in India
## Project Overview
This was created on February 1, 2021. This project was aimed to analyze the air quality in India. It is important to study because India has high population density and in the United States we need to draw comparisons with how other countries are treating the environment. 

## Configuration Instructions
For optimal configuration I would recommend having Excel on a Windows machine. Running the project in Google Colab is best for the ipynb file. 

## Installation Instructions
For this, this ipynb file needs to uploaded into Google Colab. Log into Google Colab and click the upload button, from there choose the file from your desktop. In addition, the data file needs to be downloaded and uploaded to Google Colab as well by clicking the files tab on the left hand side. 

## Operating Instructions
To run the code you need to click on Runtime at the top and choose Runall. If you want to individually run each cell that is also possible. 

## A list of files included
* data.csv file was found on Kaggle regarding the air quality in India
* An ipynb template file for the specific assignment
